# Holland-Code (RIASEC) Personality Test


This repository contains the code and resources for the Holland Codes project, which is based on Dr. John Holland's theory of categorizing people and work environments into six different groups. 

The project aims to help individuals understand their personality types and explore career possibilities that align with their interests. It was part of a research project conducted at [Universit√© III Toulouse - Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr) in the study program 'Compuer Science for Aerospace'.




## Overview

The Holland Codes project provides a comprehensive assessment tool for users to determine their Holland Code, which consists of three letters representing their primary personality types. 
The code is determined based on their preferences and similarities to the six groups identified in Dr. Holland's theory.
